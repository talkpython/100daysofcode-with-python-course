# Collections module

## Day 1: Your new data structure friends

Welcome to this lesson. Today you will learn about some powerful new data structures: `namedtuple`, `defaultdict`, `Counter` and `deque`.

Today you watch the videos. I also prepared a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/04-06-collections/collections.ipynb) so you can follow along with this lesson.

## Day 2: Practice using movie data

You get to use these new data structures I encourage you to code an exercise: [PyBites Code Challenge 13 - Highest Rated Movie Director](https://pybit.es/codechallenge13.html). 

See the [notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/04-06-collections/collections.ipynb) for more info how to complete this exercise.

You can also take a slimmed down version of this exercise [on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/bites/30/).

## Day 3: More practice on your own data

We challenge you to find your own data set and try to use the new collections data structures yourself.

Stuck at finding examples? We used `collections` quite a bit for [when we did the 100 Days of Code](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/LOG.md):

	$ python module_index.py |grep collections
	collections        | stdlib | 001, 021, 023, 034, 036, 042, 045, 055, 057, 063, 076, 084, 086, 095, 096

## Time to share what you've accomplished!
