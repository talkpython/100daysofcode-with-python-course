00:00 G'day everyone, welcome back.
00:01 This is Julian Sequeira again
00:03 and welcome to Sending Emails with SMTPLib.
00:06 This is one of my favorites
00:09 just because I love automating stuff, right.
00:12 And this is one of the first cool things
00:14 that you're going to automate with Python.
00:17 Sending emails via a script
00:19 is extremely gratifying and awesome
00:21 if you want to spam your friends
00:23 and I think you're really going to enjoy it, too.
00:26 So, the point of these videos
00:28 is to teach you how to send an email
00:30 using a script, SMPTLib
00:32 and the Python MIME modules
00:35 which I'll explain in a bit.
00:38 So, click next and carry on with the videos.
00:41 Next, we're going to set up your Gmail application ID
00:44 and then straight from there,
00:46 create a script.
